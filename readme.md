# Hangman console game using Node.js

## TODO

As a hangman player, I want to:

- [ ] start a new game of hangman
- [ ] see how many lives i have
- [ ] see how many letters there are in the word i'm guessing
- [ ] be asked to guess a letter

- [ ] if letter is in word, to be shown where it fits
- [ ] if letter is not in word, to be told so, and to lose a life
- [ ] if i've already guessed that letter, to be told so, not lose a life, and invited to guess again
- [ ] if i enter a non-letter, or more than one letter, to not lose a life and to be asked to try again

- [ ] if i have lives left, to be asked to guess another letter
- [ ] if i have no lives left, the game finishes
- [ ] if i've guessed all the letters in the word, to win the game, and to be told how many lives I used

Before each guess prompt, I want to:
- [ ] to be shown all the letters i've guessed already
- [ ] to be told how mant lives i have left
- [ ] to be shown the word so far
